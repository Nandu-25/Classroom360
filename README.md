# ClassRoom360

This idea is to solve multiple problems faced by an institution. Assuming that the customer is setting up tablets for each bench in the classroom, we need to develop software (web application) to make the class more interactive, record attendance, raise queries, take feedback, ask queries and make effective communication with the professor in and outside the class. We are also asked to develop a web application for the students to see their courses, announcements, class materials etc. The main aim is to create a workspace for students to make their lives easy.

## Documentation

-	This database is totally our choice only. We can prebuild the data base based on the customers requirement. This database is completely arbituary

- 	For our project we made a simple database of 30 student, 6 teachers, and 1 admin. For simplicity we took the class data of our class(including the teachers whose emails are our friends only). We initialized their mobile numbers ending with their enrollment number, it can be later changed in the profile page.

- We have 6 branches (CSE, ECE, Eph, EEE, Mech, DSAI) this project is limited to 6 branches only.
